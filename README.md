# PV-modules
## Sophomore project

In this project we will implement machine elarning alorithm (NN) in order to prevent the overheat of the pv-modules, this will garantee an optimal energy generation of our pv-module.
This repository will contain the whole pipelien of this project the architecture of the solution is the following : 
PV-module => sensors => database(RESTful api)we used Firebase in this project => Raspbery Pi => NN + Other gradient based computations  => Command(action)
